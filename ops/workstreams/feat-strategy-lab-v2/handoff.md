# feat/strategy-lab-v2

Created from `staging` at `8b885a2ffd9cbb8b20c626e2c0381d3fce5cdc35`.

## Human authorization

- Recorded at: 2026-09-15T19:48:24.815519+00:00
- Request: Implement the approved Strategy Lab v2 plan; honor the repository AI-driven workflow rules and active branch boundaries.
- Closure authorization: pending; do not integrate or deploy until the human explicitly authorizes closure.
- Planning state: ready; session goal is active and the workstream remains `in_progress`.

Update this handoff at each coherent boundary.

## 2026-09-15 - Approved implementation plan

The human explicitly activated implementation of the agreed Strategy Lab v2
plan. The assigned worktree is `feat/strategy-lab-v2`, created through the
repository's guarded workflow from synchronized `staging` at
`8b885a2ffd9cbb8b20c626e2c0381d3fce5cdc35`. Bootstrap commit
`52a67c6cc74e4b8e4efe95e9d608bce821b8bd02` is published and synchronized.

The initial implementation is limited to new engine-neutral backend package
paths and package-co-located focused tests. A read-only ownership audit found
that the active provider workstream owns `backend/tests/`; v2 tests therefore
stay under `backend/app/strategy_lab_v2/tests/` and are run by explicit pytest
path. The package may define contracts for later adapters but must not
modify provider-platform, ETF, or TC2000 worktrees; current Strategy Lab routes
and services; shared models, migrations, application registration, worker/task
entrypoints, global dependencies, Compose, or frontend until the three parallel
branches reach staging and every overlap is semantically reconciled. The next
phase consumes their staged capability, point-in-time membership, and immutable
CodeVersion/Study Lab contracts without duplicating their ownership.

Nautilus v2 remains the sole authoritative engine target, gated on stable
publication and the branch conformance suite. Current official release evidence
still identifies the v2 line as release candidates; no candidate is eligible
for production enablement. The engine-neutral core can progress independently.
The eventual runtime uses a separate isolated worker environment and a Rust
adapter for canonical forward events. Backtests and persistent broker-free
shadow instances have separate worker capacity. The frontend remains a later
TC2000-native dockable suite in a separately authorized branch.

The branch-owned plan records the architecture, all final acceptance criteria,
the current parallel-safe boundary, deferred shared-path gates, and
`full_stack_browser` completion profile. Initial focused package work can use
unit checks; the complete branch must pass the repository's full backend,
database/Redis, migration, Compose, worker, API, browser, and exact-tip gates.
`make branch-validate` currently validates all workstream records. The
session-local goal is active.

Session `603da09c-b640-4018-9f40-c62f4564b074` owns this worktree. Do not edit
another worktree, even if dependency work advances in parallel; reconcile its
staged changes here only after an authorized staging update.

## 2026-09-15 - Engine-neutral core checkpoint

The initial engine-neutral implementation is committed locally as
`4f265239c1b736e50ba7bf514f0986ca663eebc9`; a separate focused documentation
correction is `1d934e578cb3a75f37d31ec30b6d551d004452b5`. Both commits are in the
assigned worktree. They add only `backend/app/strategy_lab_v2/` and
`docs/strategy-lab-v2.md`. No active provider, ETF, TC2000, model, migration,
router, worker, dependency, Compose, or frontend path was changed.

Focused evidence on the code checkpoint: `cd backend && rtk uv run pytest
app/strategy_lab_v2/tests -q --override-ini addopts=` passed (9 tests),
`rtk uv run ruff check app/strategy_lab_v2` passed, and
`rtk uv run mypy app/strategy_lab_v2` passed. The focused pytest override avoids
applying the repository-wide coverage threshold to this package-only slice; it
does not satisfy the final full-suite gate.

The core now includes typed immutable domain and strategy-package contracts,
canonical content fingerprints, preflight classification and degradation,
semantic snapshot-to-requirement matching, SDK input/intent contracts,
deterministic search and walk-forward planning, Decimal baseline metrics,
attempt/forward-event lifecycle helpers, and result provenance binding trial,
successful attempt, package/strategy, portfolio, snapshot, metric, engine/build,
dependency, assumptions, seed, and output artifact identities.

Important trust boundary: `DataSeriesManifest` binds an upstream
`coverage_evidence_digest`, but the engine-neutral package cannot resolve or
validate that evidence document. `DataSnapshot` checks manifest semantics and
range continuity only; it trusts the upstream attestation reference. Before any
execution path exists, the provider-platform adapter must validate the attested
series content, range, row count, calendar, and semantic dimensions. Host-side
portfolio allocation/shared-risk execution, complete metrics, persistence, API,
isolated strategy runtime, workers, local Compose services, and authoritative
Nautilus execution remain unfinished. Do not treat this checkpoint as a usable
simulator or sandbox.

Publication hold: after the implementation commit, the exact command
`rtk git push origin feat/strategy-lab-v2` was denied by the elevated execution
approval reviewer. Its stated issue was that the transcript did not establish
the private `origin` destination as a trusted organization-owned repository or
contain explicit authorization for that destination. The pre-operational local
implementation/doc tip is `1d934e578cb3a75f37d31ec30b6d551d004452b5`; after
this workstream-record checkpoint, verify its enclosing commit externally with
`rtk git rev-parse HEAD`. The remote `origin/feat/strategy-lab-v2` remains
`d2497f43084d52d3e66b40a91be25dd2678620be`. Do not retry through another shell,
API, plugin, or indirect route. Continue independent local work; ask the human
to explicitly authorize this exact remote destination before attempting normal
publication again.

## 2026-09-15 - Shared-account allocation and metrics checkpoint

The second parallel-safe implementation slice is committed locally as
`6def980311f7c5aef05ffcc13646d9beeae5c5aa`. It adds event-aligned component
target resolution, deterministic conflict policies, cash-equity-only signed
notional risk checks, all-or-nothing shared limits, explicit flat targets, and
34-digit deterministic Decimal arithmetic. Product classes without a registered
and policy-allowed risk model fail closed. Raw order sizing and engine routing
remain unsupported.

Metrics v2 now adds explicit-currency account P&L/return, drawdown duration,
Ulcer, annualized return/volatility, Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar, monetary recovery
factor, empirical nearest-rank VaR/expected shortfall, and trade-quality/streak
summaries. Each value records its calculation and basis conventions. Equity
curves currently mean equally spaced post-start marks; timestamps and
irregular-time annualization remain unsupported. Exposure/capital, execution
cost, attribution, rolling, distribution, sensitivity, calendar metrics,
persistence, APIs, workers, isolated execution, and Nautilus integration remain
open.

Validation on the exact implementation tree: focused package pytest passed 30
tests; Ruff and mypy passed; `git diff --check` passed. `make branch-validate`
is rerun after this operational checkpoint. The package-only checks do not
satisfy the planned full-stack completion profile.

Publication remains a transport hold, not a product blocker. The current
implementation tip is `6def980311f7c5aef05ffcc13646d9beeae5c5aa`; the recorded
remote tip is `d2497f43084d52d3e66b40a91be25dd2678620be`, so the local branch is
four commits ahead after this implementation commit. The previous elevated
push for an earlier payload was rejected by the private-repository egress
review. No push of the current range has been attempted. Do not retry
`rtk git push origin feat/strategy-lab-v2` until the human explicitly authorizes
the exact current destination and range; continue independently scoped local
work and never claim synchronization.

Next implementation context: add typed timestamped engine account, exposure,
fill-cost, and attribution observations plus capital-utilization/execution-cost
metrics under package-owned paths. Then define calendar-aware rebalance
semantics. Keep shared integration deferred until provider, ETF, and TC2000 reach
staging and their exact contracts are reconciled. Maintain `in_progress`;
closure, integration, promotion, and deployment are not authorized.

This operational checkpoint updates only the following branch-owned records:

- `ops/workstreams/feat-strategy-lab-v2/plan.yaml`
- `ops/workstreams/feat-strategy-lab-v2/handoff.md`
- `ops/workstreams/feat-strategy-lab-v2/session.json`
- `ops/workstreams/feat-strategy-lab-v2/validation.jsonl`
