# feat/etf-holdings-constituents

Created from `staging` at `89bb5c05ad1635156285d392b7c39b3c341ad8f1`.

## Human authorization

- Initial continuation recorded: 2026-08-30T18:48:23.255917+00:00
- Approved plan persistence recorded: 2026-09-02
- Request: continue the existing ETF holdings provider coverage goal from the
  current green staging lineage, and persist the fully approved exhaustive plan
  so another Codex model can implement it in full.
- Closure authorization: pending; do not integrate or deploy until the human
  explicitly authorizes closure.

## Current branch state

- Latest staging merge: `9bc42091ac3d95bcc11ad8783692fb3cd8f9d2e4`
- Incorporated staging SHA: `8b885a2ffd9cbb8b20c626e2c0381d3fce5cdc35`
- Current code-derived state: 496 registered, 380 native/live-backed, 116
  fallback-only.
- Current fallback status split: 8 access-blocked, 99 discovery, 3
  non-executable public source, 6 non-portfolio-publisher (the ledger's dated
  terminal dispositions preserve each record's original runtime audit status;
  Elm, Esoterica, Even Herd, and Everence are no longer runtime fallbacks after their
  native promotions).
- `docs/etf-provider-universe.md` has been reconciled from code to the current
  496/380/116 snapshot; future updates must remain code-derived.
- Validation tier: `full_integration`.
- Local validation profile: `docker_integration`.
- The full integration gate at `2d96697d` reached e2e-functional but failed one
  unrelated Study Lab browser case (`F8p-current-history`); 153 e2e cases passed
  and 106 were skipped. A fresh-stack retry reproduced a missing histogram
  element timeout. The ETF holdings tests and routes were not implicated.
- Planning session: `197b239d-3322-4fc6-bf4b-0d0aecebf5e0`.
- Latest implementation checkpoint: `e33ddd8e` (Fundstrat Granny Shots GRNY/GRNJ/GRNI complete current holdings tables through the official Granny Shots pages; Freedom/FRDM complete current holdings table through the official Freedom ETFs product page; Framework/GSR BESO current holdings route through the official GSR product page and details/holdings APIs; Fitzgerald/Nicholas Wealth FITZ and FIZY current holdings routes through the official XFUNDS pages and nonce-scoped CSV endpoints; FalconX parent coverage through the independently managed 21Shares ARKB, TETH, TOXR, TSOL, TDOG, TDOT, TSUI, TCAN, THYP, and TKNS routes; Everence/Praxis PRXG, PRXV, and PRXI native routes; Even Herd native EHLS route; the existing
  Esoterica WUGI and Cygnet/Elm routes remain intact); prior `915282cd` (Esoterica native WUGI route); prior `a4571ff3` (Elements inactive/successor
  disposition; prior EA Series Trust dated non-portfolio-publisher disposition;
  prior DVx Ventures dated
  non-portfolio-publisher disposition; prior Discipline Funds dated
  non-executable-route disposition); prior `9cc5be81` (CresAlta native CVGD/CVSM
  holdings tables); prior `fd07b17f` (Conductor native CGV declared
  holdings CSV); prior `1aa7cc48` (Castellan native CTEF/CTIF
  holdings tables); prior `992a554d` (CapForce native FFTY/BOUT
  holdings tables); prior `b9a984c4` (Bushido native SMRI/RNIN
  holdings tables); prior `b967113b` (BufferLABS native BFLB
  holdings table and live coverage); prior Brookstone checkpoint `6aa2adb3` (Brookstone native BAMD/BAMG/BAMV/
  BAMB/BAMU/BAMA/BAMO/BAMY holdings routes and live coverage); prior Bridgeway
  checkpoint `c1caf555` (Bridgeway native BBLU/BAGX/BRSV/BSVO/BUSM holdings routes
  and live coverage); prior Blueprint checkpoint
  `ba4b80ea` (Blueprint native TFPN holdings route); prior BeeHive checkpoint `bc77c274` (BeeHive native holdings route plus
  promoted-adapter contract alignment);
  prior Ballast/Avory/ARS checkpoints are `b4c96335`/`695dea16`/`f33224ab` and
  the Guggenheim audit receipt remains `c4bef2ec`.
- Product implementation is underway; current changes add Guggenheim, ARS,
  Avory, Ballast, Bancreek, BeeHive, Blueprint, Bridgeway, Brookstone, BufferLABS,
  Bushido, CapForce, Castellan, Conductor, and CresAlta
  native coverage and issuer-specific audit dispositions for the ranked fallback
  records reviewed so far.
  The Elm implementation reuses the proven official product-page-declared full
  holdings CSV under an explicit `elm` adapter, with Elm Partners Management
  provenance and a dated source audit; it is not a generic alias to SEC data.
  The Esoterica implementation promotes WUGI through the official AXS product/
  data pages and the declared FilePoint dated aggregate CSV, with explicit
  Esoterica provenance and strict WUGI filtering.
  The Even Herd implementation promotes EHLS through the official product page
  and its declared complete daily `holdings.csv`, with strict account filtering,
  cash semantics, and preserved long/short quantities.
  The Everence implementation exposes Praxis's PRXG, PRXV, and PRXI route under
  an explicit parent-identity adapter, preserving exchange-suffixed international
  symbols, SEDOL identifiers, account filtering, cash semantics, and publisher
  relationship provenance.
- The Discipline Funds audit is explicitly not a promotion: the official DDV,
  DDX, and DDXX pages expose a nonce-backed wpDataTables loader, bounded live
  attempts did not prove a complete executable artifact (DDV had no parseable
  rows; DDX/DDXX exposed only ten rows), and the public AJAX probe returned no
  usable dataset. Commit `c1287c90` removes the experimental adapter and records
  the dated `non_executable_public_source` disposition.

## Durable implementation direction

The human-approved exhaustive plan is
`ops/workstreams/feat-etf-holdings-constituents/implementation-plan.md`.
The schema-4 contract is `plan.yaml`. A later Codex implementation model must
read both completely, follow the automatic agent-session workflow, and work
only in this branch's registered local worktree.

## Historical continuity

The former master-based branch was fully represented in staging before its
remote ref was removed. Its prior checkpoint `a8d6189` recorded 496 registered,
339 native/live-backed, and 157 fallback-only providers. Current code has
advanced to 380/116, including the Guggenheim, ARS, Avory, Ballast, Bancreek,
BeeHive, Blueprint, Bridgeway, Brookstone, BufferLABS, Bushido, CapForce, Castellan,
Conductor, CresAlta, Elm, Esoterica, Even Herd, and Everence/Praxis promotions.
Continue current gaps; do not recreate completed work or
restore a dead route merely to reproduce historical counts.

## Next action

The baseline provider-audit ledger now accounts for all 140 fallback keys and an
exhaustive invariant test proves its key/count/rank alignment with runtime code.
`guggenheim`, `ars`, `avory`, `ballast`, `bancreek`, `beehive`, `blueprint`, `bridgeway`, `brookstone`, `bufferlabs`, `bushido`, `capforce`, `castellan`, `conductor_fund`, `cresalta`, `elm`, `esoterica`, `even_herd`, `everence`, and `falconx` are native-promoted; `advisors_asset_management` and `amplius` are
issuer-access-blocked; `alphamark_advisors` is classified as an
inactive/successor disposition; `amg_national` is a non-portfolio publisher;
and `anydrus`, `baillie_gifford`, and `discipline_funds` are non-executable public sources;
`alphaclone` and `elements` are inactive/successor dispositions; `argent` and `arin` are
issuer-access-blocked; `azimut`, `desjardins`, `dvx_ventures`, `ea_series_trust`, and
`emirate_abu_dhabi` are dated non-portfolio-publisher dispositions. The Emirate
record resolves the apparent USSE source row to the separately tracked Segall
Bryant & Hamill/CI SBH identity rather than creating a duplicate sovereign
publisher route. The DVx record resolves the source identity
to the separately tracked VistaShares ETF publisher: DVx's own site is a
venture/company-creation platform, not an ETF portfolio publisher. The EA Series
Trust record resolves the trust/platform identity to each fund's actual sponsor
or sub-adviser rather than a duplicate trust-wide route. The Elements record
maps the historical Element Funds/Element ETFs identity to
CHRG, whose official SEC supplement records closure and liquidation in December
2023; the current EMG Advisors successor domain exposes no replacement ETF
holdings route. Elm's official ELM product page now provides a complete current
holdings CSV dated September 1, 2026; the `elm` adapter preserves that route
under Elm Partners Management while the existing Cygnet adapter remains available
for the parent identity. Esoterica's WUGI route is current and executable through the
AXS/FilePoint chain. Even Herd's EHLS route is current and executable through the
official product-page-declared daily CSV. Everence/Praxis's PRXG, PRXV, and PRXI
routes are current and executable through the official product-page-declared
Azure CSV convention. FalconX's ten current U.S. products are now covered through
the independently managed 21Shares publisher's page-declared primary and
secondary product-details APIs, with explicit parent/publisher provenance. The
  audit ledger currently has 79 queued fallback records still
requiring issuer-specific
evidence and final dispositions; existing terminal/blocked records must remain
evidence-backed. ETF Managers Group is now recorded as an inactive/successor
identity because Amplify's official acquisition notice documents the fund
reorganizations and sponsor transfer; current portfolio routes belong to Amplify
or the successor fund managers. Everence is resolved through the Praxis
Investment Management PRXG/PRXV/PRXI route, with explicit parent/publisher
provenance and exchange-aware parsing. FalconX is resolved through 21Shares'
current U.S. product catalogue, with current route and parent/publisher
provenance. FCF Advisors is resolved as an inactive/successor identity because
Abacus Life acquired and rebranded it; current ABFL, ABLG, ABLD, ABOT, ABLS, and
ABXB routes belong to the existing `abacus_global` adapter. First Manhattan's
official FMCX and FMCE pages identify two active products but disclose holdings
only sixty days after each quarter-end, so the ledger records it as a dated
`non_executable_public_source` rather than a native route. Continue replacing
Fitzgerald/Nicholas Wealth is now native-promoted for FITZ and FIZY through the
official XFUNDS page-declared nonce-scoped daily CSVs; FIZY option rows are
classified as derivatives and the adapter records publisher provenance.
FormulaFolios is now recorded as an inactive/successor identity after its
official October 2023 liquidation; current Brookstone ETF routes are covered by
the distinct `brookstone` adapter. Continue replacing baseline placeholders
with first-party route evidence. The abbreviated `fpa` key is now recorded as
an inactive/successor alias of the existing native `first_pacific` identity;
Framework Digital Advisors is now native-promoted for BESO through the official
GSR product page's details and holdings APIs; the SEC-listed DATZ product has no
current GSR page or API data and was not silently promoted through EDGAR. Continue
with
`freedom` is now native-promoted for FRDM through the official Freedom ETFs
product page's complete holdings table and effective date. Continue with
`fundstrat` is now native-promoted for GRNY, GRNJ, and GRNI through the official
Granny Shots full-holdings pages, including GRNI option classification. Continue
with `gc_ferry_parent`, and checkpoint
each coherent provider changeset before moving to the next.

Update this handoff at every coherent implementation and operations boundary.
